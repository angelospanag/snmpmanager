This simple example uses Trolltechs Qt 4 with Qt 3 support enabled,
as it was ported from Qt 3.

It is tested under Linux, FreeBSD and Windows 2000. Patches or fixes for other
systems are welcome.

The default is to use libtomcrypt. If you want to use it with libdes,
you have to edit QtExample.pro.

To compile: qmake && make 
For Windows an VC DSP-file is created through qmake.
